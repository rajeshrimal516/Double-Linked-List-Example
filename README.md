# Advanced-Programming-
Double Linked List Example

Create a module that represents a circular double-linked list. The module should include functions for initializing the list, adding elements to the list, deleting the nth element from the list, deleting all list elements, printing all list elements, and checking whether the list is empty (isEmpty) or full (isFull). Export the module as a static library. Using the created module for manipulating a double-linked list, create a program that will replace every two adjacent list elements if an element with a larger index is smaller than an element with a smaller index.
